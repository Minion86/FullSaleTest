Goal - Implement the Cache class to satisfy the tests in the Main.

Part 1:

Implement the Cache class to cache requests for values of the store. The cache is
initialized with a max size; requests for keys after the cache is filled should
evict the first item added to the cache and cache the new item. If the item is cached,
the store should not be accessed.

Part 2:

Improve the eviction implementation to evict items based on the last access of the item
in the cache. 

For example:

Store contains - [Item1, Item2, Item3, Item4, Item5]
Cache contains - [Item1, Item2, Item3]

If Item3 and then Item1 are fetched, a request for Item4 should see Item2 evicted and Item4
cached. Then, if Item5 is fetched, Item3 should be evicted and Item5 cached.
